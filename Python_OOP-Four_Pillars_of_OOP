#### Description
Python is one of the most sought after programming language. This course will teach you Object Oriented Programming, using Python as the programming language. You need to be familiar with the basics of Python such as Variables, Data Types, etc

By learning OOP using Python , you are taking your Python skills to the intermediate level from where you can pursue other advanced Python modules.

With the spike in growth of Data Science, Python developers are much in demand. With increase in number of Python developers, it is very important to let potential employers spot you from the rest of the 'usual' Python crowd. This is where having the knowledge of OOP becomes very important. By being able to write well designed code in Python , you are giving yourself a boost to climb up the ladder of your Python journey.

This course will help you understand how Abstraction, Encapsulation, Inheritance and Polymorphism - the four pillars, hold together the world of Object Oriented Programming in Python

Have you ever stumbled into someone else's Python code and wondered how to create Classes and Objects and other designs of OOP ? Well, this course will teach you how to start creating your own OOP designs in Python

I have related all the concepts to real world examples to help you understand them better. And with Python as the programming language, it couldn't get any simpler!

Enrol today and take your Python skills to the next level!
